[sbt-build-info-conf](http://github.com/Sensatus/sbt-build-info-conf) is a simple [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org) [AutoPlugin]
(http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Plugins.html) that uses
[jGit](https://eclipse.org/jgit/) and [Typesafe config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config)
to magically add some build information into the projects reference.conf at package time.
